phpESP is a package for PHP that provides an easy to use web-based
interface to designing surveys, deploying them on your web site, and
exporting data.  It features multiple users and user groups, with data
isolation and hiding between groups.  It is suitable for use by a
single person, a department, or an entire organization.  The surveys
created by phpESP can be easily embedded into existing HTML templates
with one or two new lines.
